# FibonacciClockPrototype
Fibonacci Clock Prototype in C

Inspired by the [Fibonacci Clock](http://basbrun.com/2015/05/04/fibonacci-clock/) invented by Philippe Chrétien, before I set out to bring the clock to Android wear, I wrote a tiny C program to test the waters.

It basically prints the clock in text with Colors, to simulate the actual clock.

Clone the repository and compile it with `make fibonacci`.

`./fibonacci` will give an example output.

The program also takes command-line args as `./fibonacci <hour> <minute>`


*Note*: The args are not validated.

The program has been compiled successfully with `gcc` and `clang` on Mac OS X Yosemite (10.10)
